<h1><b>Employer Portal</b></h1>
<p>The student employment office is currently working on a new Student and Employer portal that will simplify the process of managing positions that are available on campus.</p>
<p>When the portal is complete, employers will be able to login and submit jobs, remove submitted jobs, respond to possible applicants, and edit information about a position.</p>
