<h1><b>Mission Statement</b></h1>
<div class="clearfix">
	<img class="img-polaroid pull-right" src="./assets/img/live/usc.jpg" />
	<p>The Student Employment Office (SEO), a division of RIT's Co-op and Career Services, is responsible for administrating all aspects of on-campus employment, and for developing and implementing the Institute's policies and procedures for student employment. In addition, the SEO provides a brokerage service for students seeking off-campus part-time employment and full-time summer employment.</p>
	<p>In keeping with RIT's tradition of experiential education, student employment is seen as another aspect of the student's educational experience. The skills and attitudes developed through working, whether an extension of knowledge gained in the classroom or those related to more menial endeavors, are vital components of the student's maturation. Consequently, the SEO believes that the student's on-campus and off-campus employment should accurately reflect the realities inherent in permanent employment.</p>
	<p>We stress, therefore, the necessity of adherence to standards of punctuality, responsibility, neat appearance and diligence. Furthermore, we recognize that the attainment of these objectives is ensured through cooperative effort between supervisors of student employees and the SEO.</p>
