	<h2>FRAUDULENT EMPLOYER</h2>
	<p>Attention All Students:</p>
	<p>
		A few months back, a company by the name of Acuity Brands posted a job through the Student Employment Office website.
		  While preliminary research showed that this company was a legitiment employer, we later discovered that another company was scamming college campuses using their identity.
		  If you are in contact with Acuity Brands, please contact Public Safety and notify them about the issue.
		  If you have contacted or been contacted by this employer, please change all your passwords for your own protection.
		  Do not be fooled and be sure to check the legitimacy of all postings that you apply to.
		  We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused students and encourage you to be diligent in the future.

	<h2>Wage Theft Prevention Act</h2>
	<p>The New York State Wage Theft Prevention Act went into effect on Saturday, April 9th. This law is an enhancement of the NYS Labor Law Acknowledgement that employers currently provide to all newly hired employees. What this means to employers is that they are required to obtain a signed and dated written acknowledgement whenever a student <u>who has never worked as a student worker</u> on the RIT campus is hired by your department. Employers do not need to obtain this form from students who have previously worked on-campus.
	<p>Currently, employers are required to obtain a signed and dated NYS Labor Law Acknowledgement Form for each newly hired student worker. This form has been replaced with three new forms; Notice for Hourly Rate Employees, Notice for Multiple Rate Employees, and Notice for Exempt Employees. In addition to a new form format, you will notice several additional items, some of which do not apply. I will identify those items that do not need to be answered for you below. One noticeable difference on the forms is that the acknowledgement must also include an affirmation that the employee accurately identified his/her primary language to the employer and that the notice provided by the employer was in the language identified. <u>At this time, New York State has only provided the forms in English. You will be notified of the changes or new forms as they are made available.</u>

	<p>The new forms can be found on the SEO website (<a href="http://www.rit.edu/seo">www.rit.edu/seo</a>) on the 'On-Campus Employment Forms' page. You will notice a new grouping of forms under the title 'NYS Notice and Acknowledgement of Pay Rate and Payday Forms'. All three forms require you to answer 'Employer Information'.</p>

	<u><b>Notice and Acknowledgement of Pay Rate and Payday:</b></u>
	<p>This form will be used for the majority, if not all, of your student workers. This form is to be used for new student workers who work one job in your department.  All items must be answered, except for item '4 - Allowances taken'. Leave item 4 blank.</p>

	<u><b>Notice for Multiple Hourly Rate Employees:</b></u>
	<p>This form is to be used for new student workers who are being hired into multiple jobs at different pay rates within the same department. Item '4 - Allowances Taken' does not need to be answered. Item 7 (Overtime Pay Rate) is just a statement of what the expected overtime rate will be for each position if overtime were to be received. No answer is required.</p>

	<u><b>Notice for Exempt Employee:</b></u>
	<p>This form will be used for Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTA's) only. Employers may disregard items '4 - Allowances Taken' and '7 - Overtime Pay Rate'. You may leave these two items blank. Once the appropriate form is completed and signed, a copy must be given to the student and the original must be attached to the SEO Hire Form and sent to Student Employment where the forms will be kept for six years. There will be changes to this process as New York State makes more information available. In the meanwhile, your cooperation with the process outlined above will be greatly appreciated.</p>
	<p>This notice must be given to employees on an official form from the New York State Department of Labor at the time of hiring, before they do any work.  The employer must complete the form and have the employee sign a statement of acknowledgement of the written notice and keep the signed statement for 6 years.</p>

	<h2>Student Employment Procedure Change</h2>
	<p>Given that RIT employs approximately 8,000 student employees annually, the Student Employment Office receives thousands of student payroll forms to process during each academic quarter. The SEO staff works diligently to process the paperwork as quickly as possible, but there are several issues that slow down our progress and that's why we're asking for your help.</p>

	<u><b>Faxing:</b></u>
	<p>Many of you have been faxing student payroll forms to the Student Employment Office for processing. However, the sheer volume of faxes sent to us is causing issues between our department and some of yours. We have been receiving faxes that are blank, faxes that are too light to read, faxes that are incomplete, etc. As a result, the SEO staff is spending valuable time trying to decipher the paperwork and answering your calls asking if we received your faxes when the time should be spent actually processing the paperwork. To ensure that we receive the paperwork in its entirety, we are asking that you have the paperwork hand delivered or put it into the interoffice mail. <u>Starting Wednesday, December 8th, we will no longer be accepting faxed paperwork unless requested by a member of the SEO staff.</u></p>

	<u><b>Send Backs:</b></u>
	<p>To avoid having student employment paperwork returned to you, please follow these few simple steps.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Check to see if the student has the 2012/2013 Employment Eligibility Card with registration verification for the current quarter. <u>If the student does not have an Employment Eligibility Card, do not send the paperwork to us.</u></li>
		<li>Make sure that the SEO forms are complete prior to sending them to us. Incomplete forms cannot be processed.</li>
		<li>Use the correct pay period start and end dates. The Bi-Weekly Pay Schedule can be found on the SEO website at <a href="http://www.rit.edu/seo">www.rit.edu/seo</a>.</li>
		<li>Be sure to include the NYS Acknowledgement Form with the hire paperwork for new hires (they are not necessary for rehires) and complete the form in its entirety, including the overtime rate for hourly wages <u>(the over-time rate is required for all students)</u>.  The overtime rate is 1.5 times the hourly rate.</li>
	</ol>
