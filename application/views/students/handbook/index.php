<p><b><a name="1"></a>1. Introduction</b></p>
<p>
	Students work for a variety of reasons. Some need their earnings to meet the basic costs of an
	RIT education, while others want their earnings for social activities. Still others recognize that
	skills and work habits gained on the job will benefit them when they seek full-time employment,
	and simply enjoy the camaraderie of work groups.
</p>
<p>
	Each year, more than 8,000 RIT students are employed through the SEO, a division of the Institute's
	Cooperative Education and Career Services Department. The SEO is responsible for administrating all
	aspects of student part-time and summer employment, including the Federal Work-Study Program (FWS),
	and for developing, implementing, and monitoring the Institute's policies and procedures for student
	employment.
</p>
<p>
	The SEO is here to aid you in your job search, to ensure that you are properly compensated for your
	work, and to mediate any problems or concerns arising from your employment.
</p>
<p>
	If you are looking for a part-time job to help pay for your expenses while at RIT, or if you want to
	gain valuable work experience while attending classes, this guide will tell you what you need to know
	about getting a job on or off the RIT campus.

<p><b><a name="3"></a>3. The Federal Work-Study Program</b></p>
<p>
	The Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program is a federally funded program administered by RIT to promote
	access to employment. This program assists students who demonstrate financial need as defined by
	the Federal Government. The Financial Aid Office selects on the basis of financial need as many
	participants for this program as funding allows.
</p>
<p>
	Earnings during the academic year vary and are dependent upon maximum earnings level and the number
	of hours actually worked. Each student is paid bi-weekly by check or direct deposit for the number
	of hours worked. FWS earnings are considered income, and subject state and federal taxes. Please
	refer to the <a href="#12">Tax Guidelines</a> section for more information.
</p>
<p>
	Financial need is defined as the difference between the total cost of a student's educational expenses
	and the amount of money the student and his or her parents are expected to contribute to those costs.
	To be eligible to receive a FWS award, a student must meet the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Be in need of the earnings from such employment in order to pursue a course of study.</li>
	<li>Be capable of maintaining a good standing in such course of study while employed.</li>
	<li>Be a matriculated student.</li>
	<li>Be a citizen of the United States or an eligible non-resident.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Students are expected to apply FWS earnings toward educational expenses at RIT. FWS earnings are not
	automatically applied toward tuition. FWS awards that are not used cannot be carried over to the next
	academic year. Any money that is not earned from the award is considered unrecoverable. The amount
	unearned is not credited toward your tuition bill. Students who have reached their award limits are
	advised to go to the Financial Aid Office to inquire as to whether their award can be increased. FWS
	is not automatically renewed. Students must reapply by the deadline of April 1st of each year.
</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<br>
<p><b><a name="4"></a>4. Finding a Federal Work-Study Job</b></p>
<p>
	The SEO is responsible for the employment component of the FWS program. It is our policy to assist as many
	FWS students as possible to find employment. However, it is the student's responsibility to complete
	the job search, application, and interview process with the employers and then to obtain the Student 
	Employment Eligibility Card from the Student Employment Office. Students who are persistent in seeking
	employment, regardless of the job, will be certain to find work on-campus. If you are having difficulty 
	finding employment, you are strongly advised to schedule an appointment with an SEO staff member as soon 
	as possible. They will do whatever they can to assist you in seeking part-time employment.
	<br>
	<br>
	All employment procedures, including how to find job, wages, and payment procedures are identical
	for students with or without FWS awards.

<br>
<p><b><a name="5"></a>5. Qualifying for On-Campus Employment</b></p>
<p>
	For on-campus student employment, you are required to obtain a Student Employment Eligibility Card from the
	Student Employment Office. To do so, you must first have an offer of employment and bring the Student 
	Employment Verification Form to the Student Employment Office which your supervisor has completed for you.
	You must also be a full-time matriculated RIT student, AND be registered for a minimum of 12 credit hours
	for the quarter(s) you wish to work. You will be required to complete the government mandated I-9 Form to
	prove your employment eligibility by submitting appropriate documentation to the SEO staff. 
	<a href="/seo/assets/docs/i-9-acceptable-documents.pdf">Required I-9 Form documentation</a>
</p>
<p>
	The SEO also functions as a brokerage service for RIT students seeking off-campus employment. To apply
	for off-campus jobs you must first check the <a href="?/students/offcampus/">Off-Campus Job Postings</a>
	located on the SEO website. Directions for application are found on each job listing. It is the student's
	responsibility to contact the employer to schedule an interview. The employer will make the hiring
	decision. If at any time you encounter problems with an off-campus employer, you are advised to contact
	the SEO immediately at 585-475-2631.
</p>
<p>
	If you are an International student, please refer to the section on Employment Eligibility for International
	Students.
</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<br>
<p><b><a name="6"></a>6. International Students - Employment Eligibility</b></p>
<p>
	To be eligible for on-campus employment and before a Student Employment Eligibility Card can be obtained,
	international students must first:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Have an offer of employment from an RIT Employer</li>
	<li>
		Be enrolled with a minimum of 12 credit hours, or have a full-time equivalency for the quarter(s)
		of employment.
	</li>
	<li>Have a valid F1 or J1 Visa.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	International students are allowed to work up to 20 hours per week during academic quarters, and up to
	40 hours per week during breaks and approved vacation quarters. Due to the nature of the International
	Student Program, International Students are entitled to one vacation quarter per academic year, upon
	approval by the International Student Services Office (ISSO). During the approved vacation quarter, 
	International students amy work up to 25 hours per week during the academic quarter and up to 40 hours
	per week during break periods.<br><br>
	International students seeking employment who <u>DO NOT</u> already have a Social Security Card
	must have a job or job offer BEFORE he or she can apply for a Social Security number. International students 
	must follow the procedures listed below:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Search for employment via the SEO website or by visiting employing departments through the campus.
	</li>
	<li>
		Once you have an offer of employment and the Employment Verification Form provided to you by your supervisor,
		you are required to obtain an Employment Eligibility Card from the Student Employment Office. Be sure to bring 
		your I-20 or DS-2019 with passport and visa to the SEO.</li>
	<li>
		After getting a job, ask your employer for a copy of your Student Employment Hire Form and take the
		form to the ISSO.
	</li>
	<li>
		The ISSO will provide you with a letter of verification for the Social Security Administration.
	</li>
	<li>
		You are now eligible to apply for your Social Security Number. The ISSO will provide you with
		additional information on obtaining your Social Security Card.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	F1 and J1 Visa Status:
</p>
<p>
	International students are responsible for keeping their status up-to-date. Students must notify the SEO
	whenever their I-20 (for F1 Visas) or DS-2019 (for J1 Visas) are updated. <u>Students with expired status are
	not eligible to work.</u> Thirty days prior to a student's I-20 or DS-2019 status expiration date, the student's 
	employers will receive an e-mail alert advising them that a student's status is about to expire. At the end of the 30 days,
	if the student has not updated his/her visa records in the SEO, the student will be terminated from employment.
</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<br>
<p><b><a name="7"></a>7. International Students - Off-Campus Employment and OPT</b></p>
<p>
	There are certain criteria that must be met in order for the International students to be eligible to
	work off-campus. For more information, contact the International Student Services Office.
</p>
<p>
	International students are eligible for 12 months of optional practical training (OPT). OPT provides an
	opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge with practical work. Such employment may take place at any
	location in the United States. For more information, contact the International Student Services Office.
</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<br>
<p><b><a name="8"></a>8. When to Begin Employment</b></p>
<p>
	Students do not necessarily need to start employment when they come on-campus. During the academic year,
	students may choose, for example, to begin work in January rather than September. However, there are a
	number of factors to consider before deferring employment. First, students may not be able to work in
	certain departments that may initiate most of their hiring in the Fall Quarter. In addition, starting
	later in the year may not allow students with FWS awards to reach the maximum earnings level of their
	award amount.
</p>
<p>
	When students will work is dependent upon choice of jobs and willingness/ability to work during the
	summer. Students may work part-time during the academic year and full-time during June, July and August.
	During summer sessions, however, all students are employed through institutional funding. Students may
	also be able to work full-time when classes are not in session during break periods throughout the
	academic year.
</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<br>
<p><b><a name="9"></a>9. Job Searching</b></p>
<p>
	Once you are registered full-time status for the quarter you wish to begin to work, you may start your job search.
	Job listings are posted on the SEO website. All information on how to apply can be found on each listing. Students
	are also encouraged to go directly to employing departments, such as any Dining Services venue, to inquire about
	job availability. Some employers may set-up a specific time for students to come to their department to apply for
	employment. Keep checking the SEO website for any notices of these events.
	<br>
	<br>
	If at any time you encounter problems finding on-campus employment, please feel free to 
	<a href="?/home/contact/">contact the SEO</a>.
</p>
<p>
	The SEO also sponsors an annual job fair that is traditionally held before classes begin for the fall
	quarter.
</p>
<p>
	More than twenty on-campus employers will be present to take applications and/or hire students on the
	spot. It's a great opportunity to look for on-campus employment. Additional details regarding any future
	Job Fairs will be forthcoming on the SEO website.

<br>
<p><b><a name="10"></a>10. On-Campus Job Classification and Work Hours</b></p>
<p>
	On-Campus student jobs are classified according to the skills and experience required, going from
	Level 2 to Level 5, with Level 5 being the highest.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Level 2: </b>Semi-skilled or positions with some degree of specialized knowledge or training
		requiring little or no experience and are routine and well-supervised. Examples of these types of
		positions are file clerks, food service workers, campus tour guides, office assistants, and data
		entry clerks.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Level 3: </b>Specialized knowledge and training requiring at least one year of experience,
		independent judgment, and at times, supervisory responsibility such as parking attendants,
		student ambassadors, computer operators, and athletic trainers.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Level 4: </b>Two or three years of specialized course work, specialized training, experience,
		and a high degree of independent judgment. These positions may also involve supervision of others.
		Examples of these types jobs are tutors/note-takers, graders, and lab assistants.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Level 5: </b>Designates a category of jobs, with wages being determined individually based on
		comparable or identical full-time positions. The skill requirements and employee responsibilities
		of such positions are identical for student employees and full-time employees. These jobs may also
		include those positions in which a student has worked during the previous quarter in an on-campus
		co-op position, and is continuing in the position as a regular student employee. These jobs also
		require a highly specialized skill and/or several years of previous experience. Examples of Level 5
		jobs are web developers, research assistants, computer programmers, and supervisor positions.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The average student works 8 to 12 hours a week. While classes are in session, students may work up to
	a maximum of 20 hours per week, if the job permits. When classes are not in session, students may be
	able to work up to 40 hours per week. The number of hours per week and actual hours to be worked will
	be determined by the employer. Most on-campus employers will work around the student's class schedule.
</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<br>
<p><b><a name="11"></a>11. Wages and Payment Procedures</b></p>
<p>
	The hourly rate is based upon the level of your job as it falls within the job classification system.
	Each level is assigned a starting wage and two merit levels. Merit increases are based solely on
	performance and are granted by the student's supervisor. Merit increases can be implemented anytime
	throughout the year. In addition, employers have the option to pay students in approved Level 5 positions
	wages that may exceed those provided in the wage table.
</p>
<p>
	Students are paid bi-weekly by check or direct deposit. Paychecks are distributed at the work site
	every other Friday and cover the hours worked for the previous two weeks. Students are paid on an
	hourly basis.
</p>
<p>
	Direct deposit of wages is highly recommended for student workers. Forms can be obtained from the SEO
	or Payroll websites or by stopping by the Payroll or Student Employment Offices. Students taking
	advantage of the direct deposit option can view their paystubs online. For access, students must logon
	to <a href="http://finweb.rit.edu/controller/payroll/">http://finweb.rit.edu/controller/payroll/</a>,
	and follow the directions provided.

<p><b><a name="12"></a>12. Tax Guidelines</b></p>
<p>
	Earnings, including FWS earnings, are subject to all federal, state and local income taxes. All students must file a 
	<a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf">Form W-4</a> 
	and
	<a href="http://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/2011/fillin/wt/it2104_611_fill_in.pdf">IT-2104</a>
	for tax purposes when they begin to work at RIT. If you are a nonresident alien (NRA) student, you may be subject to
	special withholding requirements; please <u>do not</u> submit these forms and contact Keithaleen Jones in the Payroll Department -
	<a href="mailto:ktjpay@rit.edu">ktjpay@rit.edu</a>. 
	<i>*In the event that you do not submit either form, tax withholding will occur 
	at the single with zero exemptions level (does not include NRA).</i>
	<br>
	<br>
	Students are <u>not eligible</u> to claim "exempt" on the Form W-4 unless all of the following apply:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The student's income exceeds $950 and his income includes more than $300 of unearned income (for example,
		interest and dividends) AND;
	</li>
	<li>
		The student can be claimed by another person as a dependent on their tax return AND;
	</li>
	<li>
		Last year the student had a right to a refund of all federal income tax withheld due to no tax liability AND;
	</li>
	<li>
		This year the student expects a refund of all federal income tax withheld because the student expects to have no tax
		liability.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Students are <u>not eligible</u> to claim "exempt" on the IT-2104 unless the following conditions are met:
</p>

<br>
<p><b><a name="13"></a>13. Social Security And Medicare Taxes (FICA)</b></p>
<p>
	Full-time, matriculated students are exempt from paying Social Security Tax (FICA) if they meet the
	following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Student is registered for a minimum of six credit hours per quarter.</li>
	<li>Student is physically working on the RIT campus.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Students who are registered for less than six credit hours or are paid by RIT, but working at an
	off-campus location, will have FICA taxes deducted from their paychecks at a rate of 6.2% with
	RIT paying the matching share. Therefore, it is extremely important that the employer indicate on
	the SEO Hire Form if the student is working off-campus.
</p>
<p>
	Foreign students with a valid I-20 or DS-2019 are exempt from this policy.
</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<br>
<p><b><a name="14"></a>14. On-Campus Co-op Employment</b></p>
<p>
	Co-op employment is a mandatory component of many RIT degree programs. It is essential that
	on-campus co-op employment meet the criteria of program validity inherent in the Institute's
	commitment to quality experiential learning.
</p>
<p>
	 It is RIT policy and practice that all on-campus co-op students be hired according to the
	 following procedure:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		On-campus co-op positions are listed with the Center for Cooperative Education and Career Services.
	</li>
	<li>Students seeking on-campus co-op respond directly to the departments listing the positions.</li>
	<li>RIT Student Hire Forms are to be completed and returned to the SEO for processing.</li>
	<li>
		The student must have a completed I-9 Form on file in the SEO to be eligible for work, and must
		also be registered for co-op.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The SEO will no longer publish the annual Co-op Wage Schedule. Employers may use their own discretion
	when assigning co-op wages. For assistance, employers may contact the Co-op Office at 475-2301 to request
	a copy of their most recent Co-op Wage Survey.
</p>
<p>
	Unlike regular student employees, on-campus co-op students are also eligible for holiday pay for all
	Institute holidays falling within a given co-op employment quarter. They are also eligible for sick pay
	on the ratio of two days per quarter worked. Sick day benefits are cumulative to a maximum of six paid
	sick days. On-campus co-op students are not eligible for Unemployment Insurance Benefits. On-campus co-op
	employees are exempt from FICA withholding as long as they are registered for co-op.

</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<br>
<p><b><a name="16"></a>16. Job Benefits</b></p>
<p>
	RIT student employees are covered by New York State's Workers' Compensation if injuries are incurred
	while on the job. If students are unable to continue to work due to an illness or an injury sustained
	other than in the course of employment, the student will be eligible for New York State statutory
	disability benefits. In either case, contact your supervisor immediately for instructions. Students
	are not eligible for sick pay, holiday pay, or unemployment insurance benefits. However, if required
	to work on an Institute Holiday, students will be paid time-and-a-half for hours worked.
</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<br>
<p><b><a name="17"></a>17. Standards of Employment and Student Conduct</b></p>
<p>
	Student employees are representatives of RIT and are expected to act in a manner consistent with the
	mission and goals of RIT and their department of employment. RIT student employees are expected to be
	punctual, reliable, dress appropriately and perform work in a satisfactory manner. Students are also
	expected to comply with all federal, state and local laws while working for the Institute on or off
	its property. Working under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances is not permitted. Theft
	of tangible items or computer time, or misuse of telephones (i.e. unauthorized long distance personal
	calls), equipment or facilities available to students during their work hours is grounds for immediate
	dismissal and possible prosecution. As student employees are paid for actual hours worked, any student
	found adding unauthorized work hours will be immediately terminated from employment and may face
	criminal charges.
</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<br>
<p><b><a name="18"></a>18. Job Related Problems</b></p>
<p>
	Students should make a serious attempt to resolve any on the job problems with supervisors or peers.
	If the problem cannot be resolved at this level, then an appointment should be made with a staff member
	of Student Employment. Student Employment will in turn, contact the supervisor or peer in a final attempt
	to resolve the problem informally. If informal attempts to resolve the problem are unsatisfactory, a
	formal grievance procedure is available. Additional information can be found at <a href="http://finweb.rit.edu/humanresources/policies/unethicalconduct.html" target="_blank">University Resources for Discussing and/or Reporting Concerns about Unethical Conduct, Harassment, or Discrimination</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Students, who have completed the employment eligibility process and have worked for an on-campus employer
	for three weeks or more without receiving a paycheck, should check with their supervisor as soon as the
	first expected paycheck is not received. Often times the problem can be rectified immediately and
	arrangements can be made for the student to receive partial payment of wages owed. If the supervisor cannot
	assist the student with the problem, then the student is advised to contact the Student Employment Office.
</p>
<p>
	Remember, the benefits of working extend far beyond the obvious financial ones. Getting a job and working
	to the best of your ability will provide valuable learning experience not otherwise available. Your job
	may or may not be career related, but you will have opportunities for growth and success!
